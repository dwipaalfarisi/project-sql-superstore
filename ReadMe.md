## 1. Acquire The Dataset
Dataset is provided by Wanda Kinasih (from her YT channel): [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dm-zQB9uIiNe6-c7y7X5q8uxY6GWTf0g)<br>
Download the dataset from both sheets as `csv`. 

## 2. Clean The Dataset
There are some problems with this dataset that I think would affect when querying, such as:<br>
*(for orders table)*
- column names have spaces;
- inconsistent date format;
- the last column does not have a name

*(for customers table)*
- column names

#### Action 1: Delete the last column in the Orders table

#### Action 2: Change the column names:
Orders table:

| row_id | order_id | order_date | ship_date | ship_mode | customer_id | country | post_code | region | product_id | category | sub_category | product_name | sales | quantity | discount | profit | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Customers table:

| customer_id | customer_name | segment | city | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|

#### Action 3: Clean the data
If you notice, date format in `order_date` and `ship_date` in the Orders table are inconsistent.
There are two types: `DD/MM/YYYY`and `MM/D/YYYY`. <br>
I use Excel to match SQL default date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).<br>

1. Select all column rows and perform `Custom Sort` -> `Sort by: order_date`-> `Ok`
2. You will find the date data are split into two categories: fixed to the left and fixed to the right. Select all data since this is not a date format.
3. Go to menu `Data` --> `Text to Columns` --> choose `Delimeted`, then `Next` --> untick all Delimiters, then `Next` --> choose `Date` and `MDY`--> `Finish`
4. Do the same thing for  `ship_date`
5. Select all rows --> `format cells` --> `custom` --> for the Type: use `YYYY-MM-DD` --> `Ok`
6. You will see the two columns' values are now set to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

## 3. Import into MySQL
#### Action 1: Create a database and connection for the project
1. Login to  MySQL and create a database:
```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE superstore;
```
2. Create connection session to MySQL. Here, I use **SQLTools** *extension* in **VS Code** for the connectionâ€”Navigate to `.vscode/setting.json` for the connection settings. Saving the file will create `superstore_project.session.sql` file.
4. I will use `superstore_project.session.sql` to create table, insert data, query, etc.
5. Use *superstore* database:
```
USE superstore;
```
6. Create `customers` table:
```
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
    customer_name TEXT,
    segment TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);
```
6. Show the upload folder:
```
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";
```
Copy the values. In my case, it's:<br>
`C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads`
<br>
<br>
Copy `Orders.csv` and `Customers.csv` datasets into the above directory.

> **Note**: You can import the dataset using the workbench and skip this step. If using terminal or `session.sql` file from `SQLTools`, follow this step.

7. Load the data into `customers` table:
```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/Customer.csv' INTO TABLE customers 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```
>**Note**: Try checking the table by using ```DESC customers;``` OR
```SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;```

8. Create  `orders` table:
```
CREATE TABLE orders (
    row_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_id  VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
    order_date  VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
    ship_date DATE NOT NULL,
    ship_mode VARCHAR(14) ,
    customer_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    country TEXT,
    post_code VARCHAR(5),
    region TEXT,
    product_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    sub_category TEXT,
    product_name TEXT,
    sales DECIMAL(10, 4) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    discount DECIMAL(10, 4),
    profit DECIMAL(10, 4),
    PRIMARY KEY (row_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

9. Load data into `orders` table:
```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/Orders.csv' INTO TABLE orders 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```
>**Note**: Try checking the table by using ```DESC orders;``` OR
```SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;```

## 4. Solve some questions
To perform query, I'll use a new connection called `query_superstore.session.sql`. I'll execute and save all my queries inside this connection file.<br>
>To see the raw queries, navigate to `query_superstore.session.sql`

<br>_Feel free to use any method to query from the database._

```
SELECT  DISTINCT(customer_id), 
        city, 
        MIN(order_date) first_buy
FROM    (
        SELECT  t2.city, 
                t1.order_date, 
                t1.customer_id

```
SELECY  customer_id,
        city 
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN ('AZ-10750', 'CP-12340', 'MH-17440'); 
```
**Result:**
| customer_id | city |
|:---:|:---:|
| AZ-10750 | New York City |
| CP-12340 | New York City |
| MH-17440 | New York City | 
<br>

>**Note**: This particular query can differ depends on what database is used to query. The caveat of this query is down to the table `customers` which doesn't have connector column `order_id` as in `orders` column. This means if the one customer have several cities, it can't deter which city belongs to which order. This causes confusion. 
- In MySQL, as the result above suggested, we would get the city from `JM-15655` customer, as only one city: `Bridgeton`. But if we take a look at `customers` table, customer `JM-15655` actually has several values for `city` column such as: `Los Angeles`, `Carlsbad`, or `Glendale`.
- In BigQuery, it will return several city, not one.
<br>

Considering the following caveat, ***this query (problem 4.2) is not valid***.

#### **Problem 5:**
Find the first order GMV (sales) of each customer. If there is a tie, use order with the lower oder_id
<br>
```
SELECT  customer_id, 
        MIN(order_date) first_buy, 
        order_id, 
        sales
FROM    (
        SELECT  customer_id, 
                order_date, 
                sales
        FROM orders
        ORDER BY order_id
        ) t1
GROUP BY customer_id, order_id, sales
ORDER BY first_buy, order_id;
```

**Result:**
| customer_id | first_buy | order_id | sales |

ORDER BY 1, 2, 3
```

**Result:**

#### **Problem 6:**
Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second order within 7 days of any other of their orders. Output a list of customer_id(s) of these returning active users.
<br>
First, get the next order for each customer and find the difference (in day) between the order and the next order.
```
SELECT  customer_id, 
        order_date, 
        next_order, 
        DATEDIFF(next_order, order_date) difference
FROM    (
        SELECT  customer_id, 
                order_date,
                LEAD(order_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) next_order 
FROM orders
) t1
```
**Result:**

| customer_id | order_date | next_order | difference |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AA-10315 | 2017-03-31 | 2017-03-31 | 0 |
| AA-10315 | 2017-03-31 | 2017-09-15 | 168 |
| AA-10315 | 2017-09-15 | 2017-09-15 | 0 |
| AA-10315 | 2017-09-15 | 2018-04-10 | 207 |
| AA-10315 | 2018-04-10 | 2019-03-03 | 327 |

| AA-10315 | 2020-06-29 | 2020-06-29 | 0 |
| AA-10315 | 2020-06-29 | NULL | NULL |
| AA-10375 | 2017-04-21 | 2017-10-24 | 186 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
<br>

Now, get id, only when the difference is <= 7 days. Use CTE.

```
WITH returning_user AS  (
SELECT DISTINCT(customer_id)
FROM    (
        SELECT  customer_id, 
                order_date,

                DATEDIFF(next_order, order_date) difference
        FROM    (
                select  customer_id, 
                        order_date,
                        LEAD(order_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) next_order 
                FROM orders
                ) t1
        ) t2
WHERE difference <= 7
        ) 

SELECT * FROM returning_user ru
